# Mobile shop

## Description 

The C++ code that we wrote serves as a console-based mobile phone store management system. The system employs structures and enums to model entities such as administrators, customers, and mobile phones, fostering a more organized and modular code structure. By implementing functions for various tasks like adding new items, checking stock, and managing orders, the code showcases encapsulation and abstraction principles. The recursive function izrArtikal adds a touch of complexity, encouraging a deeper understanding of recursion. While the code provides a functional foundation for inventory management, there is room for improvement. In essence, this project offered us practical experience in applying object-oriented principles to real-world scenarios, contributing to the enhancement of our object-oriented programming skills.
